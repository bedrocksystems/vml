Notwithstanding any other provision of the GNU lesser General Public License
version 2.1, if you modify the Library, your modified version must prominently
offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if
your version supports such integration) an opportunity to receive the source
code of your version (including, without limitation, all the source code needed
to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to
modify your version, including scripts (to control those activities), by
providing access to such standard or customary means of facilitating copying of
software. For the avoidance of doubt, linking with the Library using a suitable
shared library mechanism, shall be deemed not to constitute a modification for
purposes of that addendum
